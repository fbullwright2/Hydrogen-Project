<h1> A Physics Based Hydrogen Equation for Calculating Carbon Accreditation of Hydrogen </h1>
<h2> Why This Matters </h2>
<body> Carbon Credits are an emerging market, as both a carbon offsetting solution and a revenue stream. This project delves into the complexities of drawing up a carbon accredition methododology in accordance with Verra Gold Standards. It uses physcis equations to prove minimal leakages and permanence of methane sequestration in the form of hydrogen. </body>
<h2> Why I Did This </h2>
<body> Following a consulting project on carbon credits generafted from a climate tech, i wante to delve into the technincalities of this proposal. This methodology is inspired by, although unrelated to, said project with 180 Degrees Consulting </body>
